        <h2>Instuctions</h2>
        <p>
            Othello is a two player strategy game so grab a friend. One player will be
            <br>placing black tokens while the other places white.
            The goal of the game<br> is to have more of your tokens on the board when the game ends.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whenever a token is placed it must be in a way that creates a <br>straight line with
            a disc of the same color on the other end and discs of <br>your opponents color filling in the middle.
            After placing the disc all of your opponents <br>discs in the line will be flipped to your color.
        </p>

        <p>With the starting setup these are all of the possible black plays:</p>

        <p>If black placed at the top-most option this is how the board will look after playing:</p>
        <img src="images/flipping_white.png" alt="">
        <p>Following that, these are all of the possible white plays:</p>
        <img src="images/white_possibilites.png" alt="">
        <p>
            The players will take alternating turns until neither player has anywhere they can play. <br>
            At this time whoever has the most tokens of their color wins.<br>
            If one player can't place a token but the other player still could,
            <br>they must pass their turn to the other player before continuing on normally.
